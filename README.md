- üß† My ability to think critically, and learn and adapt quickly always makes me an outstanding candidate as a software developer. This adds to the extensive knowledge, skill and talent which I have in software development, an activity I find nothing but fun because of a series of problem solving tasks.
- üíª I‚Äôm interested in a couple of tech related fields but I mainly focus on web and mobile development with a lot more experience in web than in mobile.
  I'm that kind of guy who reads about current trends in technology and explores them so as to stay updated in this ever evolving tech landscape. I do not end there. I love to narrate stories about these trends to others to create awareness and have more people become tech enthusiasts.
- üéØ I‚Äôm looking to collaborate on SaaS and Enterprise projects among others.
- üì´ Contact Me: joel8tnz@gmail.com - I'm always open to new opportunities.
- ‚ö° Fun fact: I recommend coding, math and physics to people struggling with depression.
